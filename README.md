## Supported input devices
* HID Mouse
* HID Keyboard
* HID Mouse/Keyboard Combo
* HID Joystick/Gamepad*
* Xbox 360 Controller**

**Descriptor parsing is a work in progress and may not work for all devices.*  
***Currently, only the Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver is supported.*

## Outputs
* PS/2 Mouse* port
* PS/2 Keyboard**/Mouse port (combined)
* Gameport

**All types are supported, including IntelliMouse (5 Buttons + Scroll Wheel).*  
***Scancode Set 2*

## Supported Arduino Boards
* [SparkFun SAMD21 Mini Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13664)*

**Other ATSAMD21G18 boards should also work well, provided they have the same pinout.*

## Usage

* Power the board using a USB cable and set the **Power select** jumper to **USB**.  
  **Alternative:** Set **Power select** jumper to **Gameport**. Be aware that the current is limited depending on the host machine.

* Use a USB OTG cable to connect your USB device to the Arduino.  
  **Recommendation:** Connect a USB hub to the Arduino if you want to use multiple USB devices.

### Joystick / Gamepad Mapping

| Xbox 360 Controller | USB Joy 1         | USB Joy 2         | Gameport |
|:--------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:---------|
| X-Axis 1 or D-Pad   | X-Axis 1 or D-Pad |                   | X-Axis 1 |
| Y-Axis 1 or D-Pad   | Y-Axis 1 or D-Pad |                   | Y-Axis 1 |
| X-Axis 2            | X-Axis 2          | X-Axis 1 or D-Pad | X-Axis 2 |
| Y-Axis 2            | Y-Axis 2          | Y-Axis 2 or D-Pad | Y-Axis 2 |
| A or R2             | Button 1          |                   | Button 1 |
| B or L2             | Button 2          |                   | Button 2 |
| X                   | Button 3          | Button 1          | Button 3 |
| Y                   | Button 4          | Button 2          | Button 4 |

### LEDs

* **LED1** is **ON** if the host inhibits any PS/2 port.
* **LED1** is **FLASHING** if data transfer occurs over any PS/2 port.
* **LED2** indicates **Joy Button** press or the highest **Axis Value**.

### Setup Mode

* **LED1/CapsLock** blink count indicates the current setting.
* **LED1/NumLock** is on while in edit mode.
* **LED2/ScrollLock** indicates the value of the current setting.

#### Bindings

| Keyboard        | Joystick/Gamepad      | Function                                   |
|:----------------|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| CTRL+SHIFT+WIN  | Joy5 (R1) + Joy6 (L1) | Hold for 1s to enter/exit setup mode       |
| Return          | Joy1 (A)              | Edit setting / exit edit mode              |
| Right Arrow     | Joy5 (R1)             | Next setting / increase value (edit mode)  |
| Left Arrow      | Joy6 (L1)             | Prev. setting / decrease value (edit mode) |

#### Settings

| #Blinks | Setting               | Default  |
|:--------|:----------------------|:---------|
| 1       | Swap joy axis 3 and 4 | ON       |

## Developer Notes

* Diagnostic information is available via **Debug Conn. @ 115200 8N1**  
  *Sending any character returns sent/received data and device status.*

* Enable USB Debugging in `USB.h` *(in USB_Host_Library_SAMD)* by uncommenting `#define DEBUG_USB_HOST 1` and setting `#define USB_HOST_SERIAL` to `SERIAL_PORT_HARDWARE`.

* You can change pins in `include/Config.h`.

* Depending on your computer's Gameport capacitance, you may need to adjust the values in the `AXIS_TO_POT_VALUE` macro.  
  This macro is in `lib/Gameport/include/Gameport.h` and can be modified to calibrate the hardware for your system.  
  Be aware that if the resulting value is too low, it might not be properly detected by some applications, including Windows.

* You can add support for additional USB devices by implementing a `JoystickDriverMapper` and adding it to `joy_mappers` in `main.cpp`.
